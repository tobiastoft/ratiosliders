DESCRIPTION
===========
Replaces any DOM element with a segmented slider. The slider contains a 
hidden form field with the same name as the replaced element, containing 
the output values from the slider. The output values are returned as a 
JSON string with the same format as the string used to set up the slider.


HOW TO USE
==========
The slider is built on JQuery 1.6.2 and JQuery UI 1.8.16. These are
included in this package, however, can be left out if the site is
already using JQuery.

The following files would normally need to be included in the html:

	<!-- JQuery -->
	<link type="text/css" href="css/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css" rel="stylesheet" />	
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.6.2.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.json-2.2.min.js"></script>
	
	<!-- RatioSlider -->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="ratiosegment.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="ratioslider.js"></script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/ratioslider.css" />

There are two ways of configuring the slider. It can be done as a part
of the creation of the RatioSlider object or the configuration can be
stored in the form field that the slider is replacing.
In any case, the slider is set up by passing it a JSON string containing
the desired segments and the total value (e.g. 130% for overprovisioning).

A new slider is configured like this:

var mySlider = new RatioSlider(DOMobject, config);

Where DOMobject is the object to replace (e.g. a text field). The 'config'
parameter is optional, if omitted the RatioSlider class will look for a
suitable configuration string in the DOMobject's 'value' field.

The JSON configuration format looks like this:

	{"segments":{
		"Segment A":0.4,
		"Segment B":0.3,
		"Segment C":0.3,
		},
		"total":110
	}

The 'segments' portion defines the segments by name and initial value.
NOTE: The values are always fractions of 1, even when overprovisioning.

The 'total' is the total percentage, normally 100% but when over- or 
underprovisioning it will be e.g. 70% or 130%. The segments are always
calculated as fractions of 1.

Here's an example of a slider that will replace the form element named "ratioslider2":

	var rs2 = new RatioSlider("ratioslider2", {"segments":{"Cheese burger":0.4,"Kebab":0.3,"Falafel":0.1,"Hot dog":0.2},"total":130});

Please see the included 'example.htm' for an example of two sliders. The
visual design of the sliders is defined in the 'css/ratioslider.css' file.

Please note that this is a very early and not very thoroughly tested 
version of the slider.
